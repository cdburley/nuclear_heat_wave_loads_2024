# nuclear_heat_wave_loads
This repository houses the raw data and processing scripts to create the hourly load time series by 
Balancing Authority for the nuclear project. Data are scaled to match the 2030 annual total loads data by BA. 2030 loads
were shared by Kostas on 2-Feb 2024. The future loads for different weather years are based on the Total ELectricity 
Loads (TELL) model.

## Input Files
The input data needed to recreate this process is stored in the [data](data/) directory.

## Output Files
The output of this processing is stored in the [data](data/) directory with the filenames 
"TELL_Loads_2030_Based_on_YYYY_Weather_With_Climate_Change.csv".

## Summary Plots
Quick-look plots analyzing the data are stored in the [plots](plots/) directory.

## Notes
1) Loads in CISO, IPCO, NEVP, and PACE are modeled as a whole in TELL but are separated in GridView. To create the data
for these BAs I used the whole load simulated by TELL and distributed it to the subregions within the BA using the 
annual total load in each subregion to portion out the TELL loads.
2) The BAs in Canada (AESO and BCHA) and Mexico (CFE) are not modeled by TELL. The time-series for those BAs are the 
same as those in the original GridView file. Likewise, there are no values for TH_Malin, TH_Mead, and TH_PV.
